        <p>Areet, my name is David Ingledow and I’m a designer based in Newcastle upon Tyne.</p>

        <p>I’m fascinated about how we design, build and experience technology in our everyday lives. I often write about these ideas on my <a href="{% url 'blog_index' %}">blog</a>. I also post rambling thoughts and all the cool things I find on to <a href="http://twitter.com/dingledow" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm currently designing and building awesome things at <a href="https://www.sopost.com/" target="_blank">SoPost</a> &mdash; exploring new ways of bridging the gap between online and physical experiences. Since joining the amazing team at SoPost, contributing and sharing code on <a href="https://github.com/dingledow/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> has been an essential part of my work, but I also occasionaly share what I'm working on to <a href="https://dribbble.com/dingledow" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> as well.</p>

        <p>I love music. I can move my way around a piano, as well as a drum kit, but can't wait to pick up and learn another instrument soon. Why not take a look at what I've been listening to recently on <a href="http://rdio.com/people/dingledow" target="_blank">Rdio</a>.</p>
